During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Sekhon displayed remarkable bravery while defending the Srinagar Air Base against a Pakistani air raid.</p>

Though his aircraft was eventually shot down, his actions prevented further damage to the base. He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy.</p>
