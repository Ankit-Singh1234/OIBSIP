  <li><a href="https://github.com/Ankit-Singh1234/OIBSIP/tree/main/TASK%201%20Calculator">Task 1</a>: ## Task 1: Scientific Calculator

This task is on the development of a **Scientific Calculator** with a friendly user interface that could perform various mathematical operations. This calculator is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and the following features have been added into it:

- **Basic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations.
- **Advanced Operations:** Square root, cube root, power functions, exponentiation, logarithmic (`log`, `ln`), factorial (`n!`), and trigonometric (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`) calculations.
- **Constants and Special Functions**: This would include constants like Ï€ (Pi) and would support special functions like backspace and all-clear (AC).
- **Interactive UI**: It features an interactive UI that updates the display in real-time. This shows either the current input or result, with smooth hover and active effects on buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout fits different screen sizes, ensuring usability on various devices.
- **Background Image:** It uses a mathematical background image, 'math.jpg', to make the interface look more beautiful.
